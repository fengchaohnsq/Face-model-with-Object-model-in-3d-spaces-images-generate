# Face-model-with-Object-model-in-3d-spaces-images-generate

1.glfw_face_textured_object_camera_control _save_image
  This code used face data which is ply format to generate 3d face. And it used object data which is also ply format and texture picture to genetare 3d object.
  Then we put those 3d face and 3d object togther into a 3d space, the obejct moves randomly with virtual sphere orbit.
  When you click the left mouse button, it will save 1 image in to a folder, the folder name is face_object_images.
  You can also use WSAD on the ketborad to control position of camera.
  The GLSL language used to input the 3d coordinates, colors, textures into shader. 
  It also controlled the camera parameters which is about projection,view,model size etc.
  GLSL also can be used to samulate illumination.

2.glfw_face_textured_object_camera_control _auto_save_images
  This code used face data which is ply format to generate 3d face. And it used object data which is also ply format and texture picture to genetare 3d object.
  Then we put those 3d face and 3d object togther into a 3d space, the obejct moves randomly with virtual sphere orbit.
  When you click the left mouse button, it will save 100 images in to a folder, the folder name is face_object_images_ with current year month time.

 Those files could be opened by jupyter lab or jupyter notebook.
 
 You may also need other packages,and you can find it in requirement file.
